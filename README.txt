Hi, all these are the source code for my research project, where I collaborated
with Ong Wei Sern and Teo Keane.
The research paper can be found in this directory.
Most of my work is in GUI.cs (WindowsFormsApplication3 -> GUI.cs) and in
building the LEGO robot wheelchair.
The rest of the files were inherited from the research institution as we built
our project on top of existing research.

The function of the GUI.cs file is to:
    1. Connect the LEGO robot wheelchair to the computer
    2. Manually control the LEGO robot wheelchair
    3. Start multi-threading to allow for the use of a touch sensor
    4. Change the speed of motors to adapt to different surfaces
